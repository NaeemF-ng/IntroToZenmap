# IntroToZenmap

Overview: In this repository I will be covering what Zenmap is, my experience with zenmap, and my thoughts on it.

What is Zenmap?
Zenmap is basically a user friendly graphical interface for the tool nmap. It provides most of and if not all of the same functionalities for network scanning and security auditing. It also has some additional features such as the ability to save data in multiple formats when it comes to writing reports, you can create profiles which allow you to save scan settings, scan result visualization, etc.

How i've been using Zenmap: When I started getting hands on experience the first step was reconnaissance, which basically means use nmap. Using nmap felt overwhelming when it came to adding additional commands such as -p, -sV, -O, etc. I just felt like it was so much possibilities and then on top of that you have to understand what the commands do. When I started using zenmap I became more comfortable because it was user friendly, it tells you where to plug in your target machine, explains the scans, and much more. 

Thoughts on Zenmap: I feel like Zenmap is a great tool for someone who is just getting started in this field, and would recommend this before using nmap. I just feel like its more user friendly, I honestly didn't have to search up a video when using it because everything is already done for you. The scan are already configured for the most part so all you have to do is pick a scan rather than entering it manually. 

Check out my Zenmap hands on module when it becomes available.
